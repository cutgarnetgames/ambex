A silly game made in two hours with LibGDX and flixel-android. Involves toaster.

Really horrible code, hacked together, but might be of some use. Art and code are entirely public domain should anyone ever find it of use. In order to compile and run, you will need LibGDX libs and flixel-android, which you can get from here: http://forums.flixel.org/index.php?topic=6820.0 or (up to date) here: http://code.google.com/p/flixel-android/

If you just want to play the game (god forbid) go here: http://www.cutgar.net/alphas/ambex.zip

If you want to ask my why I did this: mike @ cutgar.net

Thanks!
